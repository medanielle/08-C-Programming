Write a function encodePigLatinPhrase that encodes English-language phrases into pig Latin.

Pig Latin is a form of coded language often used for amusement.
Many variations exist in the methods used to form pig-Latin phrases.
For simplicity, use the following algorithm:
To form a pig-Latin phrase from an English-language phrase:
  1- fragment the phrase into words.
  2- To translate each English word into a pig-Latin word, place the first letter of the English word at the end of the English word and add the letters "ay".

 Thus the word "jump" becomes "umpjay", the word "the" becomes "hetay" and the word "computer" becomes "omputercay".
 Blanks between words remain as blanks.

 Assume the following:
 - The English phrase consists of words separated by blanks, there are no punctuation marks, and all words have two or more letters.
 - If the English phrase is just white space(s), the pig latin phrase is the empty string ""
 - The pig latin phrase is of max length of 80 characters

 The function encodePigLatinPhrase takes a string of english phrase and return a string of Pig Latin Phrase

char* encodePigLatinPhrase(char* englishPhrase)

	char* pigLatinPhrase;

	return pigLatinPhrase;
