/*
Write the processMatrix function that receives a two-dimensional array. The size of the array
will be such that the there are always 5 columns but the number of rows may vary and this
value is also provided to the function.

This function needs to iterate through the entire array and do the following:

1. if both indicies of the array are even numbers [0][0], [2][2] etc, then the value stored
at that index should be multiplied by two and stored back into that index

2. if both indicies of the array are odd numbers [1][1], [3][3] etc, then the value stored
at that index should be divided by two and stored back into that index (take note this is integer division)

3. All other elements should be unchanged.

4. All values in the array should be added together after the updates are made and the function should
return the total.
