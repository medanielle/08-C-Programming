/*
The function packCharacters packs four character values into a four-byte unsigned int variable.
The first character will be placed in the first byte of the int variable, the second character in the second byte,
the third character in the third byte, and the fourth character in the fourth byte 
So for ch1=a, ch2=b, ch3=c, ch4=d, the returning int = abcd

The function char* unpackCharacters(unsigned int pack) to unpack characters from a four-byte unsigned int.
The unpackCharacters function returns a pointer the unpacked characters.
The first character in the array will contain the fourth byte of the unsigned int
so for int pack = abcd, the returning char * = {d,c,b,a}
