/*
Vowels in the English language consist of a, e, i, o, u and sometimes y. For this exercise, y 
is considered a vowel if it doesn’t start a word such as yes and yellow.  If a y is anywhere 
else in a word it is considered a vowel such as try, or cyst.

Write a function countVowels that accepts a character pointer to an array representing a 
sentence, and a struct pointer (struct defined in TestCode.h header file). The function should compute 
the total number of vowels in the sentence and return it. The function will also count the 
number of individual vowels in the sentence and increment the associated counter in the struct.  

aCount for 'a' or ‘A’ etc.

- If sentence is empty or NULL, return ERROR_EMPTY.
