//		   You will be provided with two buffers and their lengths: a buffer containing the encoded string
//		   (packedString), where each value has been left shifted by 1 bit (which, given that ASCII
//		   has 127 allowable ordinal values, still keeps us under the 1-byte boundary!), and outBuffer, where
//		   all of the de-obfuscated output should be stored.
//
// Expected Return Values:
//		- The task is successful: ERROR_SUCCESS (0)
//		- Bad input is provided: ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER (87)
