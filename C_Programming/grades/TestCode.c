/*
In a computer programming course, a student’s overall score is computed as follows. The student takes four (4) quizzes, and six (6) projects,
a Midterm exam, and a Final Exam.

The student’s lowest project score is discarded therefore only including five (5) projects in the scoring.

Each score is in a range from 0 to 100.

Essentially, the overall score is computed using the values below as such:

Final – 30%
Midterm – 25%
quizzes – 5% each
Projects – 5% each

overallScore = final * .30 + midterm * .25 + quiz1 * .05 + quiz2 * 05 + ....etc……

Write a function computeScore that accepts the final exam score as an int, midterm exam score as an int, 
an array of six project scores as ints, and an array of four quiz scores as ints. The function should compute the 
floating point average of the student’s score, then round the score to the nearest integer and return it.


- If any score is < 0 or > 100, return ERROR_INVALID_DATA
