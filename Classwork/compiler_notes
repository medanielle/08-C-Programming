compiler (gcc):
	- gcc --version; check the version of gcc installed (if installed), immediately exits the program once the version is displayed
	- We quickly discussed that we will be using NASM with Visual Studio Community Edition on windows for assembly
	- -g | adds debug symbols to output executable (enables debugging for the program)

gdb:
	- crash1.c from #classpractice  (issue 0 division error when x becomes 0)
	- crash2.c from #classpractice  (issue out of index range for z array assignement)
	- infloop.c from #classpractice (issue once y > 10, x is continuously added and subtracted by 1)
	- wrong.c from #classpractice   (issue choice set to 1 in if statement '=' vs '==')
    
	- compile code with gcc -g
	- call *.out file with gdb (i.e. gdb *.out)
	- set breakpoint
		break (line number)
	- start the program
		run (executes the code)
	- check variable a variables value
		display i
	- layout next (displays the source code as you run in gdb)
	- quit or q	(exit gdb)
	- step or s	(moves to the next line in the code, if the next line is a function, steps into the function)
	- next or n	(moves to the next line of code)
	- clear	(line#)	(removes the breakpoint)
